## Whats hierarchy

Azure provides four levels of management: 
***management groups -> Subscriptions -> Resource Groups -> Resources***
 ![hierarchy](photos/hierarchy.png)

***Management groups*** help you manage access, policy, and compliance for 
multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically 
inherit the conditions that are applied to the management group.

***Subscriptions*** associate user accounts with the resources that they create. 

***Resource groups*** are logical containers where you can deploy and manage 
Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.

***Resources*** are instances of services that you can create, such as virtual 
machines, storage, and SQL databases.
