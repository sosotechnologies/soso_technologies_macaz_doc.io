Theres always been this lask of understanding between machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Put in context, artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience.

##  Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
 Artificial Neural Networks the most important part of the deep learning model, they are the brain inspired deep learning tool which replicate the way humans learn. 

 ***The Neuron***

 In the Human Body, the Neuron is a part of the brain and nervous system. The three broad functions of the CNS are:
 
 - To take in sensory information

 - process information, and

 - To send out motor signals.

  ***But Now How do Neurons Connect?***

  Neurons communicate with each other by sending chemicals, called neurotransmitters, across a tiny space called a synapse, between the axons and dendrites of nearby neurons.

 So, now that we have that understanding of a human neuron, and how the neurons connect, the goal of AI was to replicate the way the human brain learns. In another sence, create machines that would have the ability to learn, adapt, and make decisions.

 ### Neurona in AI

 As seen in the diagram below, the Input Values are independent Variables of [1, 2, and m]. These variables need to be standardized to make sure all variables contribute evenly to a scale when items are added together, or to make it easier to interpret results of a regression or other analysis.
