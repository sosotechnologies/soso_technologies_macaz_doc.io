   **Note**. You Must have an understanding of ***volume_handle*** - (Required) A map that specifies static properties of a volume. For more info see Kubernetes reference. This is the way I am mapping the EFS I.D  to the Volume.
   The volume handles is not neccessary for dynamic provisioning, because you will not creating a PV file, and you will be using storage Provisioner to dynamically create the PV's. Pass the provisioner in your storage Class Object.

For your mount_path = "/data", any data in the mountpath will be store in your EFS. You can name to whatever u choose

```k exec --stdin --tty soso-pod --/bin/sh```

MY ADVISE - use different S3 buckets for critical backends, so If an s3 is mistakenly deleted some how, you can create a new bucket and re-initialize that specific resource group.
