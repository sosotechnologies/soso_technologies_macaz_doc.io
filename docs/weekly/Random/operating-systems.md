# Introduction to Computers and understanding Operation systems

## What is an operating system?
An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. 
It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software 
and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing 
how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.    
For the most part, the IT industry largely focuses on the top five OSs, including 
Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, Google's Android OS, Linux Operating System, and Apple iOS

### Focus: Linux
Linux is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified 
and distributed by anyone around the world. This is different from proprietary software 
like Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it. The advantages of 
Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions—or versions—you can 
choose from. Some common Linux distributions are Debian, Fedora and Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint.
