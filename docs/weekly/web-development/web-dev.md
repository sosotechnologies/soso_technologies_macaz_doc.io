### HTML
A typical HTML Skeleton will look like:

|         Description                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <!DOCTYPE>  All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
<head>  The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag   |

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>This is sosotech</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Enter your content here -->>
</body>
</html>
```

 Here are some of the commonly used html open and closing tags.
