# ELK - Elastic Stack

ELK Stack is the worldâ€™s most popular log management platform.
The ELK stack is an acronym used to describe a stack that comprises 
of three popular projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 

 - ***Elasticsearch***
   is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene

 - ***Logstash***
   is used for both shipping as well as processing and storing logs

 - ***Kibana***
   is a visualization tool which is hosted through Nginx or Apache

 ***Some popular Use Cases for ELK are:***

Logging, Matrics, Security Analysis, Business Analysis
 -  Logging - logging and analysing Data, like gaming data
 -  Matrics - like NASA Rover can sent telematrics, sensor data
 -  Security Analysis - Helps with securing comunication in Apps like Slack
 -  Business Analysis - Helps with matching people

## ElasticSearch

With ElasticSearch, User can sends search quary to your website and your 
server send those requests to ElasticSearch, Elasticsearch then processes 
this request and Responds back to the user, through the Server.

### Elasticsearch Architecture: Key Components
 
***Elasticsearch Cluster***
 is composed of a group of nodes that store data.

***Elasticsearch Node***
 is an instance that runs in a cluster. Multiple nodes can be run on a 
 single machine. When Elastic is running, you will have an instance of 
 elastic known as Node. Each Node Has a unique ID and a node. Each Node 
 belongs to a single cluster. Data is stored as documents in Elasticsearch.
 Indices are used to group documents that are related to each other. 
 When an Index is created, it comes with a Shard, by default. 
 There are the three main options to configure an Elasticsearch node:

  - Elasticsearch master node
  - Elasticsearch data node
  - Elasticsearch client node

  ***Search movement*** - client --> servers --> ElasticSearch

  ***Shards***
  is where data is stored. What you create an Index, you can create multiple 
  shards that are distributed across nodes. Each shard has its replica to 
  recover data in case of node failure. The primary shard and replica shard is 
  always placed on different nodes. Horizontal scaling or scale-out is the main 
  reason to shard a database. The number of shards depends heavily on the 
  amount of data we have.

  ***Shard Example use Case 1***
   ![elastic2](photos/elastic3.png)

   - A BCBSNC Elastic engineer has 900k documents that they want to store. 

   - Each Shard can only Hold a maximum of 300k Documents

   - Two more shards of 300GB each will be added bringing the total storage 
     capacity to 900K Documents


  ***Shard Example use Case 2***
   ![elastic3](photos/elastic4.png)

   
   ***Scenario 1:***
   - An Elastic engineer searches 500k documents that is stored in a single Shard 

   - The response time for searching 500k Documents in a single shard is 10 seconds.
  

   ***Scenario 2:***
   - An Elastic engineer runs a parallel searches of 500k documents that are 
     distributed in 5 Shard.
     
   - The response time for searching 100k  Documents/Shard will be 2 seconds.

   - So, the response time for searching all 500k Documents that are distributed 
     amongst the 5 shard will still be 2 seconds.


 
## Kibana

 Kibana is a data visualization and exploration tool used for log and time-series 
 analytics, application monitoring, and operational intelligence use cases. 
 It offers powerful and easy-to-use features such as histograms, line graphs, 
 pie charts, heat maps, and built-in geospatial support.

   ***Kibana Aggregations***

   There are two main types of aggregations 
   
   1. ***Metric aggregations***  
     are used to calculate a value for each bucket based on the 
     documents inside the bucket.

   2. ***Bucket aggregations***
     are used groups documents together in one bucket according to your logic 
     and requirements, while the Metric aggregations
